          <p>The Renewable Energy, Water Supply and Sanitation Promotion Centre (REWSSPC) is a registered company that seeks to promote the dissemination of renewable energy technologies and the sustained functioning of water supply and sanitation infrastructure through private sector engagement. REWSSPC targets central terai districts of the Nepal with district-based staff and a coordinating office in Chandranigarpur 1, Rautahat. Due to a combination of economic, political and cultural factors, these districts have very limited experience with renewable energy technologies (BETs) and have been labelled Low Penetration Districts by the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), a division of the Ministry of Environment. Water supply is primarily through private and public ownership of shallow tube wells that require continued maintenance to ensure functionality. Sanitation is a huge challenge, with typically less than 20% of the population having access to any form of toilet, with the remaining population practicing open defecation.
          </p>
          <p>
          REWSSPC is working as Regional Service Center (RSC) of Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC)/National and Renewable Energy Program (NRREP). We have combine field-based social marketing activities with a centralised ‘one-stop-shop’ at its headquarters in Chandranigarpur, Rautahat. we supports the after-sales service needs of customers seeking technology spares and advice as well as providing advice and marketing RE and WaSH technologies to new customers. Its extension network of social mobilisers throughout the terai districts in which it works is unmatched in the region.
          </p>
          <p> 
              In its inception phase, REWSSPC has received backstopping and advisory services from SNV Nepal and AEPC with an aim to building the technical and managerial capacity of the centre to survive as sustainable business driven entity. Through its extensive network of partners from (I)NGO, government and private sectors, REWSSPC supports learning and sharing of best practices to stimulate the adoption of BETs and sustained water and sanitation infrastructure.
              The low penetration of RETs in the Central Terai (Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi,Dhanusha and Mahottari) districts was a primary motivation for REWSSPC’s initiation. A principle reason for that low penetration was the lack of private sector and NGO interest in delivering services to the area. Fears of political instability, widespread poverty and dissimilar cultures made the area unattractive for many of the Kathmandu-based organizations involved with RET promotion. REWSSPC’s Board of Directors and all staff all originate from the Central Terai Districts in which they work, and are well versed in the social, language and cultural patterns in the area, particularly in the Southern belt that is the most underserved. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Content-wise, over the past year, REWSSPC has collaborated with ESAP as a Regional Renewable Energy Support Centre (RRESC) and NRREP as a Regional Service Center (RSC) in the implementation of the Biomass based Technology dissemination efforts in central terai districts. During the formulation of the Terai implementation plan, REWSSPC installed more than 175,000 stoves and used its experiences in promoting other RETs in the Terai to build a stronger emphasis on creating demand as part of the implementation strategy. The adoption of ICS, or any other new innovation, requires a behavior change challenge that could best be addressed through a combination of awareness raising about the practical cost/benefits of ICS use and of using community social influence to create a movement to diffuse the ICS innovation. Making information available about the benefits of ICS is not enough to ensure their rapid dissemination. REWSSPC holds Ward-level Demand Creation Workshops in which it uses participatory tools to stimulate community-wide ICS adoption.
